1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,941
Madame Cheesy called
just a few days ago.

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:10,108
She'd seen shadows
lurking around her estate

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,542
and needed someone she
could trust to investigate.

4
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:17,900
It has been years
since we last spoke.

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:20,417
I admit the excitement
in seeing her.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,217
But, when I arrived...

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,367
she was nowhere to be found.

8
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,220
The police couldn't
find any leads,

9
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:34,316
so I hightailed it downtown
to the Squeak-Easy.

10
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,333
The haven for all
the riff-raff in the city.
