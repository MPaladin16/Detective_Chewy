    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: '<color=yellow>It''s over Flushy. It''s time for you to give me
      answers.

      Where is Madame Cheesy?</color>'
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: "<color=green>There was not a single night where the Madame\u2019s
      presence did not grace the tables but her husband did not appreciate the time
      we spent gambling.</color>"
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>I have lost it all, Detective. All because of that
      dame. Even on my bad streak of luck, she kept pulling on my whiskers, persuading
      me to spend my wealth.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>I do not know what happened to her, Detective. Her
      whereabouts puzzle me as much as they puzzle you.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>The last time we met, she seemed rather joyful.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>How so?</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>It was my last day at the casino, before Chippy banned
      me from her establishment.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>Wrongfully banned!</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: "<color=green>Madame Cheesy accompanied my losses that day, as
      she would normally do.\r\nAfter I was \u201Cescorted\u201D out of the premises,
      the Madame offered to drive me home, and I have not seen her since.</color>"
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>I need you to dig deeper, Flushy!</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>Was she acting erratic or perhaps paranoid that someone
      was out to get her?</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>I would not say that, Detective. She acted the same
      as always, with a smile on her face, almost as if ridiculing my banishment
      from the casino.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>She did ask me about a local underground jeweler.
      Perhaps to flaunt her wealth, but why someone of her status needed a criminal
      jeweler surpasses me.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>Who is this underground jeweler?</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: '<color=green>That would be Gemy. I have sold some of my jewelry
      to them when I was in need of funds.

      I have never met them personally.
      I have always dealt with their associates.</color>'
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>Proceed with caution, Detective, I have heard that
      they are a strange rat, and few rats know of their true identity.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>Don't underestimate me Flushy, these whiskers have
      been in hundreds of cases, and they have never been burnt.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>(Except for the case of the missing furnace, but
      that was an exception.)</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>Thank you for the information Flushy.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=green>Before you go Detective, there is one final request
      that I must make.</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>What do you need?</color>
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: "<color=green>Would you like to play one more gambling game of
      cards? I can feel it in my bones, this next one is where I\u2019m sure to win!</color>"
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: '<color=green>I just need one more game to make it back, I know
      it!

      I can smell it in the sewer, under all this second-grade cheese.</color>'
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: "<color=yellow>(I get up from the table, muffling the gambler\u2019s
      comments, focused on my new goal - finding out who this Gemy rat is, and questioning
      them.)</color>"
    DialogueSound: 
    Evidence: 
  - DialogueText: <color=yellow>(The bartender should know more about Gemy, I should
      go speak to him.)</color>
